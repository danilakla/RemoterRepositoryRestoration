[Chorus]
In New York I Milly Rock (Rock)
Hide it in my sock (Sock)
Running from an opp (Opp)
And I shoot at opp (Opp), uh, uh (What?)
And I'm on the block (What?), uh, uh (What? What?)
And I'm on the block (What?)
In New York I Milly Rock (Hello?)
Hide it in my sock (What?)
Hide it in my sock (What?)
Selling that rerock (What? Woah, what? What? Uh, what? What?)
In New York I Milly Rock (Ooh)
Hide it in my sock (Woah)
Used to sell rerock (What?)
Runnin' from the cops (Woah)
Shootin' at these opps (Woah)
